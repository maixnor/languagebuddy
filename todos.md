# Core tasks

- include a known weakness into the conversation each time you begin
- add diagnostics and visibility metrics to landing page
    - absolute hits, whatsapp chat button click (include in weekly/daily digest)
- if a user has problems and requests help my number should be sent to the user so they can directly chat with me

# Bugs

- when a user does not reply for a second day in a row the daily messages are not sent at all
    - there should be at least 2 messages per week, even if the user does not reply for a longer time

# Nice to Haves

- Streaks
    - track how many days in a row a user has replied
    - reward with badges or similar when certain milestones are reached (7 days, 30 days, 100 days)
    - show streaks in the whatsapp messages to motivate users to keep going

- Progress Tracking
    - allow users to see their progress over time
    - track vocabulary learned, conversation topics covered, and improvements in language skills
    - provide visualizations or summaries in the weekly digest

# Automation

## Daily/Weekly digests

I, the developer, want to receive a daily whatsapp message which gives me a current user count and a digest from todays feedback
A weekly message highlighting my stripe status and how many people are actually signed up for the service and are paying for it

Folliwing tim ferris: reduce to once weekly to not be overwhelmed by stuff, now daily so I can focus on improving the service even more

# Conversation History

every day before clearing yesterdays conversation with the daily init the conversation should be summed up and added to the subscriber record to keep track of the stuff that was talked about and also an update to the objectives to reflect new interests or fields of practice
