# Core tasks

- include a known weakness into the conversation each time you begin
- add diagnostics and visibility metrics to landing page
    - absolute hits, whatsapp chat button click (include in weekly/daily digest)
- if a user has problems and requests help my number should be sent to the user so they can directly chat with me

# Bugs

- when a user does not reply for a second day in a row the daily messages are not sent at all
    - there should be at least 2 messages per week, even if the user does not reply for a longer time

# Nice to Haves

- Streaks
    - track how many days in a row a user has replied
    - reward with badges or similar when certain milestones are reached (7 days, 30 days, 100 days)
    - show streaks in the whatsapp messages to motivate users to keep going

- Progress Tracking
    - allow users to see their progress over time
    - track vocabulary learned, conversation topics covered, and improvements in language skills
    - provide visualizations or summaries in the weekly digest

# Automation

## Daily/Weekly digests

I, the developer, want to receive a daily whatsapp message which gives me a current user count and a digest from todays feedback
A weekly message highlighting my stripe status and how many people are actually signed up for the service and are paying for it

Folliwing tim ferris: reduce to once weekly to not be overwhelmed by stuff, now daily so I can focus on improving the service even more
