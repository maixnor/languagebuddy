# Core tasks

- include a known weakness into the conversation each time you begin
- add diagnostics and visibility metrics to landing page
    - absolute hits, whatsapp chat button click (include in weekly/daily digest)
- if a user has problems and requests help my number should be sent to the user so they can directly chat with me

# Automation

## Daily/Weekly digests

I want to receive a daily whatsapp message which gives me a current user count and a digest from todays feedback
A weekly message highlighting my stripe status and how many people are actually signed up for the service and are paying for it

Folliwing tim ferris: reduce to once weekly to not be overwhelmed by stuff, now daily so I can focus on improving the service even more

# Conversation History

every day before clearing yesterdays conversation with the daily init the conversation should be summed up and added to the subscriber record to keep track of the stuff that was talked about and also an update to the objectives to reflect new interests or fields of practice
