I want to create an amazing onboarding process. The user should be asked for the necessary info of the profile like name, speaking and learning languages and the time zone. Then afterwards the agent should start off a conversation and ramping up the language difficulty with every message slightly until the skill ceiling of the user is hit. Then stay at the skill ceiling for a few more messages to really know the current skill level in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Only by the end of that conversation should the user be added to redis as a subscriber along with all the learning relevant data.
