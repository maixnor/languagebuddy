					<h3>How does the free trial work?</h3>
					<p>You just start texting. After 7 days we will kindly ask you to sign up using a link provided by Maya. There is no signup or anything else. Just start texting.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>Do I need to install a separate app?</h3>
          <p>No. The entire idea is to make learning a language as frictionless as possible. No extra apps to install at all. Currently only WhatsApp is supported, but we are working to support more chatting services.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>Can I switch languages later?</h3>
          <p>Of course. You can also learn/practice multiple different languages at a time. Want to learn French while preserving your Spanish skills? No problem.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>
					<p>You can cancel your subscription using Stripe.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>Is my payment information secure?</h3>
					<p>We do not handle any payment information. Everything is handled by Stripe.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>What if I am a complete beginner?</h3>
          <p>This service is aimed at having conversations. While it is possible to learn a language from 0 using Maya there might be easier approaches using different apps/services for the beginning. If you start forming phrases and sentences you should have sufficient knowledge of a language to start having conversations and learn a lot faster.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>What LLM are you using?</h3>
          <p>Currently we employ models by OpenAI. But we want to switch to Google Gemini Models soon since they are on average better performing on non-technical tasks such as for language learning/teaching.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>Can I help somehow?</h3>
          <p>We are currently developing the experience extensively. New features, platforms and overall improvements as well as bug hunting. You can actively participate if you want to. Reach out below to support and give us your feedback.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>How does the AI correction work?</h3>
					<p>We check every chat daily for hallucinations and other problems. Also you can always use the !check command to make sure the responses are correct.</p>
