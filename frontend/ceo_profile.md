# Hi. I'm Ben :)

I'm an undergrad student in university studying economics and computer science. I am from Vienna, Austria. I have just finished with my exchange semester in Lima, Peru and I loved every second of it. I am passionate about programing, nature and sports. I love hiking, Judo and now in Lima I have done a considerable amount of surfing.

# Inspiration

I needed to learn spanish for my exchange semester in Peru fast. I tried traditional language courses but I found it hard to prepare for lessons and review grammar topics before lessons. I did not feel motivated to practice anything because I was essentially not using much if any of my spanish. I also tried Anki cards, they helped a lot with e.g. learning irregular verbs such as "ser" and "estar" but the usefullness ended just about there. Learning individual words or phrases, but also that got boring and repetitive quite fast and the actual learning was not 0 but close to that. 

Then I started having conversations with LLMs and that was a game changer for me. I was finally forming sentences and I needed to communicate with someone and get my point across. But I found it to be cumbersome to start a new chat and look for the prompt I used to make the LLM behave the way I wanted it to and then it also only half the time did exactly what I wanted and I spent almost more time making sure the LLM was actually cooperating with me. Also I was missing the reminders to actually use this mode of learning.

So I was in the following situation: I use Whatsapp every day. I want to practice with LLMs. The LLM usually does not do what I want it to do and does not remeber stuff. 

# Solution

So the solution v0.0.1 for me was to have a small service that I hooked up with Whatsapp and translated almost 1:1 with a quite basic system prompt to ChatGPT. Nothing fancy and from a coding perspective also quite simple. Over the months I added more features for myself and refined the system prompts a lot (like a lot a lot) to behave the way I wanted.

And during a conversation with a friend we talked about it and he was fascinated. Then I showed my previous Spanish tutor from the courses. She was amazed. And from all that positivity I decided to give it a shot and create a service for people to use. 

Essentially I want to provide the world with the main tool I used to learn Spanish within 5 months to conversational fluidity. I call that a success. I hope my Languagebuddy - Maya - will teach you as much as it tought me, she was an invaluable tool for my Spanish journey. And Spanish definetly was not the last journey she will accompany on.
